# OWL_data

Hi, this is one of my project in late 2018, I want to analyze how to win a teamfight in the game, Overwatch, by using logistic regression.

I gather the data from <herf:https://www.winstonslab.com>https://www.winstonslab.com</herf>, this is a database of the professional gaming, 
aka Overwatch League.

The final result is good, the accuracy is about 80%.

Although it's not that accurate, but it can be used very pratically. It's a very good reference to predict teamfight results during gaming.

As for me, the conclusion of this project is very useful for me to decide when to engage teamfights and use ults while playing Overwatch.
